# README Generator

## Description
 When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Installation
In order to install inquirer, please use:
npm i inquirer@8.2.4

## Usage
Through this project, you can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command: 
node index.js
